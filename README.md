The user will be automatically redirected to those paths depending on their browser locale                                                                                           |

| numberOfTrainerProfileToPrebuild | 50      | The pages are statically rendered on demand, but for the trainer profile to reduce the load you can pre-render them.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| discord                          | -       | Discord authentication options. If you want to only check for guild membership, then fill `clientId`, `clientSecret` and `guildId`. If you also want to check role, you need to create a bot and fill `botToken` and `roleId`. `guildId` and `roleId` both accepts an array of ids and the user needs to have only one of them. |
